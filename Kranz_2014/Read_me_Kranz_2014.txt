This is the brief how-to-run guide for Antarctica CCM model \
described in Kranz et al., 2014

1.one can test the model in Matlab by running:
"CCM_lowtemp_large('Antdiatom_large_S1’)”

or

2.one can test the model in Python 3 environment by running within the same folder \
where the Antdiatom_model.py is. It is dependent on the input/parameter file\
'Antdiatom_large_S1.par' file in Antdiatom_model_MATLAB folder.

output files:
Antiatom_DIC_Fluxes.csv
Antiatom_DICs_steadystate.csv
Antiatom_model_plots.pdf
Antiatom_pyOut.csv
CCM_lowtemp_C13isotope.csv

MATLAB code was created by Dr. Brian M. Hopkinson (https://github.com/bmhopkinson)
Python code was translated by Li, Meng (https://github.com/limengwsu)
Python code was tested on March 9th 2022 last time within Python 3.7.6 using Spyder 4.0.1
